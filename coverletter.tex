\begin{cvletter}
Having a background in Signal Processing and Machine Learning, applying to be a part of \textbf{Control Systems} research group within the Department of Electrical Engineering is my most preferred choice. Prior to joining the Master's program in Systems \& Control, I worked with ML in Signal Processing and Computer Vision for about 3 years and desired to expand into the field of Motion Control. As Control Engineering and Signal Processing are ubiquitous, I decided to pursue a Master's course to widen the scope of my knowledge and work in an amalgamation of the two disciplines.\\ \\
Upon interaction with professors and members of the 4 research groups, during the specialization meet and follow-up presentations, I found my niche. Fundamental Research of the CS group appealed to me the most, along with their research in High Tech Systems. Projects of Professors \textbf{Siep Weiland}, \textbf{Paul Van den Hof}, \textbf{Roland T\'{o}th} in the fields of Data-driven Modelling, Industrial Process Control and Automation, Robotics \& Machine Learning are the ones I feel I would fit in perfectly as they are closely related to my background, research interests and current study.\\ \\
My motivation to join the group is primarily to strengthen my fundamentals and proceed for a PhD in Automatic Control \& Signal Processing. Over the next quartiles, I intend to take up courses offered by the Department of Electrical Engineering like Model Reduction, Robust Control, Knowledge Based Control, Applied Combinatorial Algorithms and Machine Learning for Signal Processing as part of my specialization and free electives.\\ \\ 
My long term career aspiration is to start a tech company and solve real world problems in the most technologically efficient manner and strongly believe that I will be able to achieve this goal with the exposure and mentor-ship the group offers it's members. I also believe my prowess in Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning would make significant contributions to the ongoing projects within the group. Combined with the guidance of peers from the CS group and my arrogance to succeed \& passion for research, I aspire to make a large impact in the society, scientific community and my career.
