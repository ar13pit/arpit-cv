\begin{cvletter}
I am applying to \textbf{MSc program in Systems and Control} for the \textbf{Autumn of 2017} at your prestigious institution. I am currently working as a \textbf{Research Fellow} for a government sponsored project, at BIT Mesra-Ranchi, aimed at the development of an ASR based IVR system to aid farmers in the state of Jharkhand.\\ \\
As a young boy of fifteen, I was well aware of the existence of several robots like Honda's ASIMO and how scientists worldwide were trying to make them intelligent. Little did I know then that six years down the line I would be working on something similar. While in my freshman year of Mechanical Engineering, I was introduced to hands on micro-controller programming by the robotics club of my institute and was really intrigued by it. I went on to participate in several college-level robotics and embedded systems competitions and learnt to program controllers of various architectures along the way.\\ \\
With time I realized that I was most interested in the tech behind making these robots smart and entered into TI's innovation challenge with an idea of building an on-board speech recognition system to aid in the sorting of courier packages in my junior year. This project was the turning point of my career. I approached \textbf{Dr. Mahesh Chandra} to guide my team and have been associated with him since then. Under his guidance I filed a patent, submitted a paper to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing and published four IEEE international conference papers with two of them being awarded ``\textbf{Best Paper}'' in the field of signal processing.\\ \\
I desire to work in the field of robotics with applied machine learning and statistics and believe that pursing a Master's course in an university as reputed as yours would give me the opportunity and the required exposure to succeed in my career. My long term aspiration is to startup a tech company to solve real world problems in a technologically efficient way. I believe my prowess in Speech Recognition, Computer Vision and Machine Learning would make significant contributions to the ongoing projects \textbf{Two! Ears} and \textbf{KSERA} at \textbf{Human-Technology Interaction} research group. I would also love to work with \textbf{Professor A. G. Kohlrausch} as we have common research interests in Auditory and Multi-sensory perception.\\ \\
TU/e's vibrant research atmosphere and strong history of nurturing entrepreneurial minds make it the ideal place for me to continue my education. I believe that my previous accomplishments, arrogance to succeed and passion for research will enable me to make a large impact at Eindhoven University of Technology. I request the university to consider my candidature and look forward to receiving an offer of admission.
